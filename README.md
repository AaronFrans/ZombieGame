# Zombie Game AI

Welcome to the Zombie Game AI! This is an artificial intelligence system designed to control the behavior of zombies in a video game. With this AI, you can create realistic and challenging zombie enemies that will engage players in intense and thrilling gameplay.

## Features

- **Zombie Behavior:** The AI governs the movement, targeting, and attack patterns of the zombies. It ensures that the zombies exhibit realistic behaviors such as roaming, chasing, and attacking the player character.
- **Pathfinding:** The AI incorporates efficient pathfinding algorithms to allow zombies to navigate the game environment intelligently. They can dynamically find their way around obstacles and choose the optimal path to their target.
- **Sensory Perception:** Zombies have sensory perception capabilities to detect the presence of the player character. This includes sight, hearing, and smell, which determine how the zombies react and pursue the player.
- **Decision-Making:** The AI uses decision-making algorithms to determine the zombies' actions based on their current state and sensory input. It enables them to choose appropriate behaviors such as attacking, following, or searching for the player.
- **Spawn Management:** The AI manages the spawning and despawning of zombies throughout the game. It ensures a balanced and challenging experience by controlling the number and distribution of zombies in different areas.

## Getting Started

To integrate the Zombie Game AI into your game project, follow these steps:

1. **Requirements:** Make sure your game project meets the following requirements:
   - Game Engine: [Specify the game engine and version supported]
   - System Compatibility: [Specify the minimum system requirements, e.g., CPU, RAM]
   - Dependencies: [Specify any additional libraries or plugins required]

2. **Installation:** Copy the AI script files into your game project's script folder. Depending on your game engine, you may need to import or include the AI scripts.

3. **Initialization:** Set up the AI system to control the zombies in your game. This typically involves creating instances of the AI class for each zombie character and linking them appropriately.

4. **Configuring Zombie Parameters:** Customize the AI's behavior by adjusting various parameters, such as movement speed, attack range, and sensory perception range. These parameters can typically be modified through the AI class or through dedicated editor tools.

5. **Testing and Iteration:** Run your game and observe the behavior of the zombies controlled by the AI. Tweak the parameters and algorithms as necessary to achieve the desired level of challenge and realism.
